## How it Works/ How it Will Work

To be completely honest, Big Tony is just a proof of concept. Its main focus is on speed and flexibility, and the hope is that any game or project, no matter what language it is developed in, will be able to utilize it. The Big Tony library will offer many important features for server development like Utility Libraries, a Job System, and Connection Manager. There will also be the ability to use an HTTP server in cordination with the UDP server so that files can be served in a more standardized way.
